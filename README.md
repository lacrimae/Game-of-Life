# Conway's Game of Life

## Overview

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton created by British mathematician John Horton
Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no
further input. The game is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of two possible
states: alive or dead. The game follows a set of rules that determine whether each cell is alive or dead in the next
generation based on the current state of its eight neighbors.

## Features

1. Adding new life by clicking on the grid. The pattern of the new life can be selected by clicking on the buttons
   labeled `glider`, `beacon`, `beehive`, `blinker`, and `
   block`.
2. TODO: Randomize the initial state of the grid each time the game is started.
3. TODO: Add a restart button to start a new game.
